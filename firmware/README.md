# Firmware

## Getting Started

* Install Nerves by following the instructions in https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html

**TODO: Add description**

## Targets

Nerves applications produce images for hardware targets based on the
`MIX_TARGET` environment variable. If `MIX_TARGET` is unset, `mix` builds an
image that runs on the host (e.g., your laptop). This is useful for executing
logic tests, running utilities, and debugging. Other targets are represented by
a short name like `rpi3` that maps to a Nerves system image for that platform.
All of this logic is in the generated `mix.exs` and may be customized. For more
information about targets see:

https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content

## Getting Started

To burn your firmware:

```
export MIX_TARGET=<target> #Â rpi3 for raspberry pi 3
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix firmware.burn
```
